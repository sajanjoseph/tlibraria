                  Roland has two companions on his quest for the tower at the portal of all the world.
                  Susannah Dean and Eddie Dean, who entered his world from New York City of 1963 and 1987, 
                  respectively.When the three track down the den of a 70-foot-tall cyborg bear, 
                  they are pointed down a path leading to the Tower. But Roland is slowly going mad, 
                  a fact that seems linked to his past experiences with Jake Chambers, a boy who died twice. 
                  Jake reappears here, displaying great resilience in crossing over from 1977 New York City 
                  to join Roland & Co. They press on, plumbing the depths of a children's book that tells 
                  a profound and ancient tale. Unfortunately, the questers don't reach the Tower; in fact, 
                  they're caught in a cliff-hanger ending!

                  to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
                  to begin his second year. 
                  But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car,

                  For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. 
                  Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to 
                  the Dark Lord, Voldemort.Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed:
                  Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. 
                  And the Azkban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts...he's at Hogwarts."
                  Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. 
                  Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.

                 The tale begins in Dark Age Britain, a land where Arthur has been banished
                 and Merlin has disappeared, where a child-king sits unprotected on the throne,
                 where religion vies with magic for the souls of the people. 
                 It is to this desperate land that Arthur returns, 
                 a man at once utterly human and truly heroic: a man of honor, loyalty, 
                 and amazing valor; a man who loves Guinevere more passionately than he should; 
                 a man whose life is at once tragic and triumphant
